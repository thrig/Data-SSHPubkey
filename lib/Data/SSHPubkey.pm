=head1 NAME

Data::SSHPubkey - utility function to parse SSH public keys with

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Data::SSHPubkey qw(pubkeys);

  # a Mojo app might accept public keys from clients, e.g.
  #   cat /etc/ssh/*.pub | curl ... --data-urlencode pk@- http...
  # this case is supported via a scalar reference
  my $keylist = pubkeys( \$c->param('pk') );
  for my $ref ( @$keylist ) {
      my ($type, $pubkey) = @$ref;
      ...
  }

  # a key collection host could instead wrap ssh-keyscan(1) and
  # pass in a file handle
  open( my $fh, '-|', qw(ssh-keyscan --), $host ) or die ...
  binmode $fh;
  my $keylist = pubkeys($fh);

  # a string will be treated as a file to open and read
  my $keylist = pubkeys( "/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub" );

  # if you do not care about the key types, extract only the pub
  # keys with something like
  ... = map { $_->[1] } @$keylist;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Data::SSHPubkey> parses SSH public keys, or at least some of those
supported by L<ssh-keygen(1)>. It may be prudent to check any uploaded
data against C<ssh-keygen> though this module should help extract said
data from a web form upload or the like to get to that step.

Currently supported public key types (the possible values that C<$type>
above may contain):

  ecdsa ed25519 rsa
  PEM PKCS8 RFC4716

Neither SSH1 keys nor SSH2 DSA keys are supported.

The C<$pubkey> data will not include any tailing comments; those are
stripped. The C<$pubkey> data will not end with a newline; that must
be added by your software as necessary when writing out the public
keys. POSIX mandates an ultimate newline, and the shell C<read>
command is buggy by default if that ultimate newline is missing:

  $ (echo data; echo -n loss) | while read line; do echo $line; done

Inner newlines for the multiline SSH public key types (C<PEM>, C<PKCS8>,
and C<RFC4716>) will be standardized to the C<$/> variable. This may
cause problems if C<ssh-keygen(1)> or equivalent on some platform
demands a specific newline sequence that is not C<$/>.

The types C<PEM>, C<PKCS8>, and C<RFC4716> will need conversion for use
with OpenSSH; use B<convert_pubkeys> or these types could be excluded
with something like:

  my @pubkeys = grep { $_->[0] =~ m/^(?:ecdsa|ed25519|rsa)$/ }
    @{ Data::SSHPubkey::pubkeys( ... ) };

or

  ... = map { $_->[0] =~ m/^(?:ecdsa|ed25519|rsa)$/ ? $_->[1] : () }
    @{ Data::SSHPubkey::pubkeys( ... ) };

to obtain only the public key material.

=head1 SUBROUTINES

=over 4

=item B<convert_pubkeys> I<output-from-pubkeys>

This subroutine converts the output of B<pubkeys> into a list of just
the public keys, with the C<PEM>, C<PKCS8>, and C<RFC4716> types
converted into a form suitable for use with OpenSSH, using the external
tool L<ssh-keygen(1)> that is hopefully installed.

=item B<pubkeys> I<filename-or-scalarref>

A filename (scalar) will be opened and the public keys therein parsed; a
scalar reference will be treated as an in-memory file and will likewise
be opened and parsed.

This routine will B<croak> on error as, in theory, all the errors should
be due to the data passed in by the caller, or possibly the system has
run out of memory, or something.

The return format is a reference to a list of C<[ $type, $pubkey ]>
sublists.

=back

=head1 VARIABLES

C<$Data::SSHPubkey::max_keys> specifies the maximum number of keys to
parse, C<3> by default. An exception is thrown if more than C<3> keys
are seen in the input.

C<$Data::SSHPubkey::max_lines> specifies the maximum number of input
lines this module will process before throwing an exception, C<100> by
default. An attacker still might supply too much data with very long
lines; webserver or other configuration to limit that may be necessary.

The C<%Data::SSHPubkey::ssh_pubkey_types> hash contains as its keys the
SSH public key types supported by this module.

=head1 BUGS

Patches might best be applied towards:

L<https://github.com/thrig/Data-SSHPubkey>

=head2 Known Issues

Probably not enough guards or checks against hostile input.

Support for the C<PEM> and especially C<PKCS8> formats is a bit sloppy,
and the base64 matching is done by a regex that may accept data that is
not valid base64.

Support for various RFC 4253 formats is likely lacking (see below or
the comments in the code).

More tests are necessary for more edge cases.

If the input uses fancy encodings (where fancy is anything not ASCII)
lines longer than 72 8-bit bytes may be accepted. C<read_binary> from
L<File::Slurper> or a traditional C<binmode $fh> should avoid this case
as the key data looked for is only a subset of ASCII (header values or
comments that are ignored by this module could be UTF-8 or possibly
anything else).

B<convert_pubkeys> calls out to (modern versions of) L<ssh-keygen(1)>;
ideally this might instead be done via suitable CPAN modules.

=head1 SEE ALSO

https://github.com/thrig/web_irulan

L<ssh-keygen(1)>, L<ssh-keyscan(1)>

L<Config::OpenSSH::Authkey> - older module more aimed at management of
C<~/.ssh/authorized_keys> data and not specifically public keys. It does
have support for SSH2 DSA or SSH1 keys, though.

=over 4

=item RFC 822

Definition of white space used in various formats C<[ \t]>.

=item RFC 1421

PEM format details.

=item RFC 4253

Mentioned by RFC 4716 but it is unclear to me what the section 6.6
"Public Key Algorithms" formats exactly are.

=item RFC 4716

Secure Shell (SSH) public key file format.
